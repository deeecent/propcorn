> [!NOTE]  
> Submitting a proposal does not guarantee funding. Proposals are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, we have a [limited budget](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xF1916936dDB48a40f833743555bB0D874a25e07f), so we need to allocate resources carefully. For any questions or to discuss your ideas, feel free to join our [Telegram Community](https://t.me/propcornprotocol). It's always better to discuss things in advance.

## TL;DR

Propcorn is a public good designed to incentivize open-source developers by enabling micro-funding for small features or fixes on GitHub. It allows developers to create proposals for issues they find interesting, set a price, and share the link to gather funding from the community. Once the funding goal is met, the funds are released to the developer after a waiting period, ensuring community approval. Propcorn is simple on purpose, focusing only on micro-funding for small development tasks.

## Problem

Currently, there is little incentive for external contributors to fix issues on GitHub. Core maintaners often have this responsibility but they manage already a significant workload with specific priorities. Freelancers or developers with the necessary skills may want to help, but they often can‚Äôt justify the time investment without compensation.

## Solution

Propcorn is a micro-funding public good where developers can propose and fund fixes for GitHub issues. Here‚Äôs how it work:

- A developer finds an interesting issue on GitHub and creates a proposal on the platform, linking it to the issue and setting a price tag.
- The developer shares this proposal via social media, encouraging others to sponsor the fix or feature with cryptocurrency.
- Anyone can contribute until the funding goal is reached.
- Once the issue is resolved, the developer marks the proposal as ‚Äúsolved‚Äù on the platform.
- After a 10-day waiting period (during which sponsors can raise objections), the funds are automatically released to the developer, unless a significant percentage of sponsors veto the payout.
- The platform provider takes a small fee for facilitating this process.

This approach creates a mini-DAO for each issue, enabling flexible, community-driven funding and development. The platform can be used anywhere, such as on GitHub or Twitter, and can even fund its own development through the same process.

## Notes

There are other similar platforms:

- https://gitcoin.co/
- https://app.onlydust.com/
- https://octant.app/projects
- https://clr.fund/

Propcorn is different because it's just a simple protocol that does one simple thing: micro-funding for small features. Just connect with your wallet, create a proposal and share a link, or fund it.
