# Sponsorship and Proposals Guidelines

We are excited to announce that this repository supports sponsorships and development proposals through **Propcorn**. Below are the guidelines for participating and contributing:

1. **Development Proposal**:
   - You are welcome to propose features or fixes for development using **Propcorn**.
   - It is the responsibility of the proposer to advocate for their proposal and gather support to collect the required funds.
2. **Funding and Development**:
   - Contributions should align with the repository’s goals and be of high quality.
   - We strongly recommend discussing your ideas and solutions with maintainers and contributors before beginning work. Open communication ensures alignment with the project’s vision and reduces the risk of rejection.
3. **Pull Requests**:
   - Submitting a Pull Request (PR) for a funded proposal does not guarantee it will be merged.
   - PRs that have not been previously discussed or do not meet the repository's standards or roadmap may be rejected.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that sponsorships and bounties benefit the entire community while maintaining the quality and focus of this project.
